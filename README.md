# MyDiploma

This is my bachelor's degree project. The topic of my research is "Users input speed as a factor of multifactor authentication". There are two ways of authentication which are being expanded by input pattern analysis: traditional touch based password and Android like graphical password. 


# Model
The model consist of autoassosiative neural network. The input of netwrok is the time distance between each beginning and end of touch(dot entrance). The resulting vector is the input of neural network. The result of the network is a time vector. The authentication process is based on comprasion of distance between the input and output vector with some kind of threshold.
